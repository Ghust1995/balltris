1. This game is about high scores
2. Do not make levels
3. A high score is influenced only by luck and resources aquired during one gameplay (i.e: you cant buy more points in any manner, and there is no persistence related to the game's main high score)
4. Minimalist/abstract theme (I cant draw and will not look for an artist)
  - Synthpop/Synthwave 80s theme decided

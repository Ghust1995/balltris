Linear interpolation when in slow motion to stop stuttering
Effects:
  - Opening and closing menus
  - Game starting
  - Next balls changing
  - Ball being dropped
  - Combo in progress / World in movement

DEBUG: Make debug print tell file (just rename print function to print('filename:', ...)

SUPER HARD: Save high score online

TEST: White balls disappearing when combo % 5 == 0
TEST: White balls only show up when a combo ends (but you still can only have one white ball queued at each time)
